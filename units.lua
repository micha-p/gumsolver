dimensions are annoying!!!

possibilities: 

- special connectors for scales => twice as much connectors
- scientific notation => annoying during input

Best solution: scaled probes during declaration!



If any symbol is used for the first time, its possible to declare its scale as:

a [%]
b [%o]
c [ppm]   # permil decimal: 137	octal: 211	hex: 89 


These scales ar not units, but its also possible to use:

a [m]
b [Â°C]
c [any]

Of course, its also necessary to scale values during input for this probe. Therefore, any connector still contains the original values for propagation within the network, but is attached to a scaled probe. Setting values is more difficult, as values from user have to be scaled to. 
Here, the run-routine checks if the connector has a scale and uses this value before setting.

Any units have to be declared before first use with directive #UNIT. Using this mechanism its possible to use unicode strings for permil without tainting the source files. Otherwise they are used but not scaled
